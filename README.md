# flugel-challenge

## Introduction

This repo aims to solve technical challenge for Flugel. 

## Challenge

### TEST #1

* Create Terraform code to create an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance. Both resources must be tagged with Name=Flugel, Owner=InfraTeam.
* Using Terratest, create the test automation for the Terraform code, validating that both resources are tagged properly.
* Setup Github Actions to run a pipeline to validate this code.
* Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.
* Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.

### TEST #2

*Complete the test #1 + the following actions:*

* Merge any pending PR.
* Create a new PR with code and updated documentation for the new requirement.
* I want a cluster of 2 EC2 instances behind an ALB running Nginx, serving a static file. This static file must be generated at boot, using a Python script. Put the AWS instance tags in the file.
* The cluster must be deployed in a new VPC. This VPC must have only public subnets. Do not use default VPC
* Update the tests to validate the infrastructure. The test must check that files are reachable in the ALB.
